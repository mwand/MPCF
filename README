This repo is for Coq developments pertaining to our work on MPCF, a
measure-theoretic version of PCF.

ICFP-2016 contains a development of a language largely the same as the one in
our ICFP submission.

ImportanceSampling adds an arbitrary (non-uniform) primitive
distribution with a density function; samples are weighted according
to their density.
