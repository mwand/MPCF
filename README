This repo is for Coq developments pertaining to our work on MPCF, a
measure-theoretic version of PCF.

MPCF starts with PCF and adds probabilistic effects via a monadic metalanguage. 

RejectionSampling/ contains an elementary version of this language,
with uniform sampling and products.

ImportanceSampling/ adds an arbitrary (non-uniform) primitive
distribution with a density function; samples are weighted according
to their density.

Observations/ adds observations from that primitive distribution.

We believe that all these developments have run successfully in Coq
8.5p11 .

However, all depend on the same assumption, namely that the
function bindopM, (fun a => strict0 (f a) (fun mu' => (mu' k))) in
MeasureSemantics.v, is itself always measurable.  We believe that some
version of this assumption is true, but we have been unable to prove
it.
